Toledo, OH and Detroit, MI Over-the-Air Logo Pack Installation


Place unzipped files in the (hidden) folder:

  C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\thumbs\tv\logos

  This is the default installation folder, if you did a custom install in a different location, place the files accordingly.


In order for MediaPortal to match the correct channel in the EPG to the corresponding logo image, the name of the channel and the image file name must be exactly the same*.

 To do this:

  - Open the MediaPortal "TV-Server Configuration" application

  - Select "TV Channels"

  - Edit the channel names

  For example, the channel name "WNWO HD" would need to be changed to "24-1 NBC HD" in order for MediaPortal to match it to the file "24-1 NBC HD.png" found in the "logos" folder.

  Conversely, you could also rename the "NBC HD.png" file in the "logos" folder to match the "WNWO HD" name in MediaPortal.


  * I've noticed an odd behavior where a space (sometimes several spaces) were included after some channel names in the "TV-Server Configuration" application. If a logo isn't appearing in the "TV Guide", but the file name and channel name appear to be correct, make sure there are no extra spaces after the channel name.



Notes:

1. The logos were tested using MediaPortal with the "Titan" skin, so they might look VERY different depending on the skin you’re using.

2. I’ll try to update the pack as I notice changes. If you have any suggestions please contact me, and I’ll fix things ASAP.

3. Big thanks to team-mediaportal.com for hosting these logo packs!!!
